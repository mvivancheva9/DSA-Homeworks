1. Expected running time is O(n^2) quadratic complexity.
2. Expected running time of the algorithm is O(n * m) because we interaction all n rows and m columns of the matrix.
3. Expected running time of the algorithm is O(n * m) because we have n number of columns and m recursive interactions in each row
